DO STUFF WHEN WEAPONS AND SPECIALS ARE USED
    SPECIALS NEED CONTROLLER HOOKUP

Instead of having Set/Clear slot messages, controllers should set that information
in their custom device state so that they get it back when they reconnect
and then the game doesn't have to do any extra broadcast work when receiving them

*SLOTS NEED TO BE NON-ABSTRACT IN ORDER TO SERIALIZE IN THE EDITOR

Fighter needs concrete set of actions - Move, Attack - which do stuff based on equipped items
