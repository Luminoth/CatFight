Loading manager (to better control the loading order, should display load step on teh loading screen)
    This should also create the required managers (which may need to come from prefabs if they have configurable state)
    This should destroy itself when it's done loading stuff
Game data manager (move this code out of the AirConsoleController)
Player teams!

Another interesting idea:
    max 10 players
    each player has their own fighter
    all slots settable with multiple types of weapons and armor
    let players *control* their fighter in different arenas vs all the other players
        up/down/left/right/fire buttons ?
