==========

Instead of having Set/Clear slot messages, controllers should set that information
in their custom device state so that they get it back when they reconnect
and then the game doesn't have to do any extra broadcast work when receiving them


*SLOTS NEED TO BE NON-ABSTRACT IN ORDER TO SERIALIZE IN THE EDITOR

Need to finish the loadout slot process/completion methods
Need to finish the item behaviors and get them hooked through the Fighter
Need to add the special network messages and controller buttons
Fighter needs concrete set of actions - Move, Attack - which do stuff based on equipped items





weapons don't combine
    vote winner wins (random tie breaker) and gets stronger by the # of votes

armor is stacking per-type damage reduction

special is vote of missiles or chaffs
    amount is equal to the votes for that special
    anybody can use at any time, but reduces available amount
